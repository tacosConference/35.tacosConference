Many people know Universität Heidelberg as a beautiful university in the old town, but there is also a brutalist building complex in the Neuenheimer Feld district, to which Heidelberg's Computational Linguistics was deported some time ago. You can admire the beauty of this complex in the background of this website right now, and hopefully in person in May 2026.",

Whether the work is a thesis, a seminar project, current research, or a pet project, TaCoS has a place for almost anything that is interesting.  In addition to the student presentations, established scientists from the host university are invited as keynote speakers. There is also a social program that offers all participants the opportunity to make contacts and network.\n\nIn short, TaCoS is a place to meet others from your own field of study, learn something new, and have fun.",
