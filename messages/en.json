	"conference_description": "At Universität Heidelberg, which was founded in 1386 and is thus the oldest university in Germany, Computational Linguistics is a relatively small field of study. Many people know Universität Heidelberg as a beautiful university in the old town, but there is also a brutalist building complex in the Neuenheimer Feld district, to which Heidelberg's Computational Linguistics was deported some time ago. You can admire the beauty of this complex in the background of this website right now, and hopefully in person in May 2026.",

It covers the fields of computational linguistics, language technology, computational humanities, artificial intelligence, and natural language processing.\n\nAt the conference, students present their work in the form of talks and workshops. Whether the work is a thesis, a seminar project, current research, or a pet project, TaCoS has a place for almost anything that is interesting.  In addition to the student presentations, established scientists from the host university are invited as keynote speakers. There is also a social program that offers all participants the opportunity to make contacts and network.\n\nIn short, TaCoS is a place to meet others from your own field of study, learn something new, and have fun.",
